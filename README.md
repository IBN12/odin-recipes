# odin-recipes
Recipe Project for the Odin Project

I will be using my HTML knowledge from this lesson to build a simple 
recipe list. There will be three main recipe links on the index (home page)
page that will redirect the user to an image, description, ingredients, and instructions on
how to cook the recipes.

Setting images up in the image tag with the src and alt attribute was demonstrated in this project.
The src attribute allowed me use two dots in the relative filepath (../) in order to go the 
parnet directory to place an image in the relative directory.
Example: src="../images/spaghetti.jpg"

Linking pages by relative paths was also done for this project. This is because links to other
pages within our own website are called relative links. No domain is needed when the page we
want to go to is on the same site. Anchor tags creat html links and the href attribute redirects
the user to the value destination. 
Example: href="./pages/about.html"
By adding (./) you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file directory
relative to current directory.
