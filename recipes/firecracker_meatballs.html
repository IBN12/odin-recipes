        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Adjust rack to to position (middle and top positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven 
                to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.
                Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Peel
                and mince ginger.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, honey, 2 tsp soy sauce (4 tsp for 4 servings),
                and sriracha to taste. (You'll use the rest of the soy sauce later.) Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small pot, combine rice, 3/4 cup water (1 1/2 cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt.
                Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes.
                Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>
                While rice cooks, in a second large bowl, combine beef*, panko, scallion whites, ginger, remaining soy sauce,
                salt (we used 1/2 tsp), and pepper. (Use 1 tsp salt for 4 servings.)
                Form into 10-12 (20-24 for 4) 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Place meatballs on one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet.
                Toss green beans on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper.
                (For 4 servings, divide between 2 sheets; roast meatballs on middle rack and
                green beans on top rack.)
                Roast on top rack until meatballs are cooked through and green beans are browned and tender. 14-16 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls or plates. Carefully add
                meatballs to bowl with sauce; toss to coat. Top rice woth meatballs and drizzle with any remaining sauce.
                Serve green beans to the side. Garnish with scallion greens and chili flakes to taste.
